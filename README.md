### An open-source 1.18.2 Minecraft Utility Mod designed around simplicity, readability, user customization and performance!

##### WARNING: THIS PROJECT DOES NOT RUN PROPERLY RIGHT NOW. THE SOURCE IS PUBLIC PURELY FOR SHARING/ASSISTANCE PURPOSES.

This project is in its early stages, I will provide a detailed documentation of it's features later on in it's development. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a simple "wrapper" client that anyone can read, understand the basics of Minecraft client operation, and develop their own forks or add in their own specific modules.

Altair's simple file structure and many other areas is inspired by BaseClient, a Minecraft 1.8.8 utility mod. You can find it's source code by clicking the button below.

The Event System of Altair uses the Pomelo EventBus and ports the Seppuku Event Manager as I did not have enough in-depth knowledge of Minecraft's filesystem to create this myself. Either way, this does the job very well so there is no point in rewriting literally 100 different listeners. I am not affiliated with Seppuku Client or it's developers, but if you are interested in the project, you can find it with the button below.

### Planned Features:

* General modules found in other clients
* A clean and customizable ClickGUI, inspired by IrisShaders' settings.
* Good performance
* No bloat (useless alt managers, confusing implimentations/imports)
* Easily readable source code and project design.
