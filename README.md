<h4>An open-source 1.18.2 Minecraft Utility Mod designed around simplicity, readability, user customization and performance! </h4>

This project is in its early stages, I will provide a detailed documentation of it's features later on in it's development. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a simple "wrapper" client that anyone can read, understand the basics of Minecraft client operation, and develop their own forks or add in their own specific modules.

<h4>Planned Features:</h4>

* General modules found in other clients
* A not horrible looking ClickGUI, inspired by IrisShaders
* Ability to hide modules from clickgui.
* Customizable UI
* Good performance
* No bloat (useless alt managers, confusing implimentations/imports)
* Easily readable source code and project design.
* Debug Module Overriding
